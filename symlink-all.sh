# A wrapper for the GCC symlink-tree script, to build a symlink tree of all
# the component directories.

# Usage:

#   symlink-all.sh <rootdir> <unisrc> <component1> <component2> ...

# The <unisrc> directory is assumed to exist. symlink-tree is run in that
# directory for each top level directory in each <componentn> directory.

# We assume that the component directories are direct subdirs of <rootdir>. We
# also assume that the symlink-tree script can be found in <rootdir>/gcc


# Set the root directory
rootdir=$1
shift

# Change to the unisrc directory
unisrc=$1
shift
cd "${rootdir}/${unisrc}"

echo "Symlink-all" ${unisrc}

# Symlink each tree
for component in $*
do
    case $component in
	binutils)
	    ignore="gdb sim"
	    ;;

	*)
	    ignore=""
	    ;;
    esac

    if ! ${rootdir}/gcc/symlink-tree ${rootdir}/${component} "${ignore}"
    then
	exit 1
    fi
done

exit 0
